&emsp;&emsp;I partly finished the style design, including the open window ,app main interfaces, the logic of jumping around and add RUA's code to my project. RUA wrote the camera shooting, video saving and local upload. 

&emsp;&emsp;I met some errors caused by the different android versions. Thanks to the Google, Android Studio solved it automatically. (using Refactor --> Migrate to AndroidX) 

&emsp;&emsp;Shortcomings still exist. Good luck later.
