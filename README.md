&emsp;&emsp;In the early morning I was too tired to add the RUA's camera part to project. Now I update it.

&emsp;&emsp;Yesterday I make the videoPlayer Page using videoview, but the speed is not so satisfying. After today's course learning ijkplayer, RUA  suggest me replacing the older one with ijkplayer. So I did it. Besides, I used gesture to up or down the volume and the brightness. DoubleClick animation also added by the way.

&emsp;&emsp;RUA modified her code about camera, making it possible to preview the video before uploading, also allowing to regret and delete the video.

&emsp;&emsp;I partly finished the style design, including the open window ,app main interfaces, the logic of jumping around and add RUA's code to my project. RUA wrote the camera shooting, video saving and local upload. 

&emsp;&emsp;I met some errors caused by the different android versions. Thanks to the Google, Android Studio solved it automatically. (using Refactor --> Migrate to AndroidX) 

&emsp;&emsp;Shortcomings still exist. Good luck later.
